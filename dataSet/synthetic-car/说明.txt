A 2.5MB sample sanitized (with personal information like VIN removed) data from cars.com is provided here. 
Data like this was used to perform the Amazon Turk experiments. 
You may run BayesWipe on this in order to see how it operates on real world noise. 
Note that there is no 'ground truth' file available (creating one would have required the author to go through the whole data tuple by tuple).

Schema: make, model, type, fuel_type, engine, transmission, drivetrain, doors, wheelbase
